Viewing old commits.

If you want to see the old version of a file, old commits in the repository, git checkout loads any of these saved snapshots onto you development machine. Cheking out old commit is a read-only operation.Viewing old versions of your commit does not affect the current state of your project. 

Please see https://www.atlassian.com/git/tutorials/viewing-old-commits/ for more details.

1] Checking out old commits and files

git checkout serves as a way to revert back to an old version of an individual file. You can re-commit the old version in a new snapshot as you would do any other file. If you want to switch to a branch to work in it and then merge the work into a branch which contains stable work (such as 'master').

2] Check the current changes

git diff shows all current local changes in working copy that are unstaged. You can also see only changes that have already been added to the staging area.
git diff also gives details of how one branch is different from another.
