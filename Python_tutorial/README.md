Python_tutorial

This directory contains interactive tutorials and examples on Python programming.

These tutorials are composed in the Jupyter Notebook environment, which allows us to create "interactive" notebooks that contain notes/instructions/hints as well as modifiable/executable Python code. For a brief explanation on Jupyter Notebook and its installation look at 'jupyter_notebook_introduction.md'.  

The optimal workflow for this tutorial is as follows: open a window in ipython and a window for your py file so you can easily run and debugg your script. Run a script in ipython with the following command: %run filename.py
After you run your script, variable names and values will be stored on ipython. Use this function to check your script.
