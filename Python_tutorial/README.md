Python_tutorial

This directory contains interactive tutorials and examples on Python programming.

These tutorials are composed in the Jupyter Notebook environment, which allows us to create "interactive" notebooks that contain notes/instructions/hints as well as modifiable/executable Python code. For a brief explanation on Jupyter Notebook and its installation look at 'jupyter_notebook_introduction.md'.
