    "#### Defining your own functions are a key step to writing legible, concise code. It allows us to practice a golden rule in programming: \"Don't Repeat Yourself\", or the DRY-principle.\n",
    "1. There are 4 `for` loops below. Can you tell which ones will fail to execute? Can you explain why?\n",

    "```\n",
    "2. Write a function, `count_vowels(in_string)`, that returns the number of vowels in a word. Test your function on some words (e.g. *sheep*, *cow*, *chicken*). Modifying the following code block could be helpful.\n",

    "    counts = 0\n",
    "    for letter in str(in_number):\n",

    "            counts += 1\n",
    "    return counts\n",
    "```\n",
    "3. Use the function `count_vowels(in_string)` that you wrote above inside a `for` loop to print the number of vowels in each word of the following text string:\n",

    "txt = \"This is the most wonderful Python exercise in the world!\"\n",
    "txtList = txt.split(\" \")\n",
    "```\n",
