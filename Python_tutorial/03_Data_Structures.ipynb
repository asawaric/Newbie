    "\n",
    "1. Write a program that sequentially prompts a user for strings that are then appended to a list. Once all entries to the list are entered, print the entries of the list in reverse order (e.g. last entry is printed first). Both lists and deques can accomplish this. A hint program that does something similar is shown below.\n",

A tool must perform its function efficiently unless this would harm the user. This is the entire reason ground-fault circuit interrupters exist. Any running tool will have its power cut if a circuit senses that some current is not returning to the neutral wire, and hence might be flowing through the user. The safety of the user is paramount. A tool must remain intact during its use unless its destruction is required for its use or for safety. For example, Dremel disks are designed to be as tough as possible without breaking unless the job requires it to be spent. Furthermore, they are designed to break at a point before the shrapnel velocity could seriously injure someone\".split(' ')\n",
