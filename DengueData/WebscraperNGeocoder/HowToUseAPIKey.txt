************************************************** Requirements and steps followed for geocoding. **************************************************************

Requirements:
'1. Python 2.7 or later.
 2. A Google Maps API key.

Steps:
 1. Each Google Maps Web Service request requires an API key or client ID. 
    API keys are freely available with a Google Account at https://developers.google.com/console. The type of API key you need is a Server key.

 2. To get an API key:

   a. Visit https://developers.google.com/console and log in with a Google(gmail) account[1].'

   b. Select one of your existing projects, or create a new project. Here new project 'LocateDengueClusters' was created.

   c. Go to the 'Library' and enable the AIP(s) you want to use. For this project only two API(s) were enabled.
      1. Directions API
      2. Geocoding API
     
   d. Enabling these APIs will give API key of 39 characters. This key can be changed to new key by 'regenerate key' option. The change will take approximately 10 
      minutes to take effect.

 3. Install 'googlemaps' using following commands (in linux):
        For python 2, 'pip install -U googlemaps' and 
        For python 3, 'pip3 install -U googlemaps'

 4. As per the example code given in [1], write a code in Python to find latitude and longitude of list of places.
    The code for 'LocateDengueClusters' project is in 'DengueClustersGeocoder.py' file.

 5. The time required to get the geo coardinates for the list of places is proportional the number of places in the list.
